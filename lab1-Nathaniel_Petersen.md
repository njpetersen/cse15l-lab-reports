# Command "cd" - changes the current working directory
## No arguments example:
![Image](example1.jpg)

In the code example above, the current working directory is first set to `/Users/nathanielpetersen/lecture1`

The `cd` command with no arguments is then run, with no output indicating an error or any output in general. However, checking our current working directory with the `pwd` command shows that our current working directory has been changed to our home directory. This shows that using the `cd` command with no arguments results in our current working directory being changed to our home directory.


## Path to a directory as argument example:

![Image](example2.jpg)

In the code example above, the current working directory is first set to `/Users/nathanielpetersen/lecture1`

## Path to a file as argument example:

![Image](example3.jpg)

In the code example above, the current working directory is first set to `/Users/nathanielpetersen/lecture1`

# Command "ls"
## No arguments example:
![Image](example4.jpg)

In the code example above, the current working directory is first set to `/Users/nathanielpetersen/lecture1`

With no arguments, the "ls" command simply reads out the contents of the current working directory, in this case, the contents of lecture1.


## Path to a directory as argument example:
![Image](example5.jpg)

In the code example above, the current working directory is first set to `/Users/nathanielpetersen/lecture1`

With the path to a directory as a argument, "ls" reads out the contents of the given directory.

## Path to a file as argument example:
![Image](example6.jpg)

In the code example above, the current working directory is first set to `/Users/nathanielpetersen/lecture1`

With the path to a file as an argument, "ls" seems to repeat the argument provided, ie the path to the file or the file's name

# Command "cat"
## No arguments example:
![Image](example7.jpg)

In the code example above, the current working directory is first set to `/Users/nathanielpetersen/lecture1`

With no arguments the "cat" command places the terminal into a mode where every key on the keyboard is logged to some collection of characters, such as the up arrow key being mapped to "^[[A".

## Path to a directory as argument example:
![Image](example8.jpg)

In the code example above, the current working directory is first set to `/Users/nathanielpetersen/lecture1`

With a path to a directory as the argument, "cat" returns a message stating that the argument given is a directory. 

## Path to a file as argument example:
![Image](example9.jpg)

In the code example above, the current working directory is first set to `/Users/nathanielpetersen/lecture1`

With a path to a file as the argument, "cat" reads out the text contents of that file.
